# Writing Guidelines for Scientific Papers

Our main (world-visible) output is text in the form of scientific reports and papers. Getting good at writing is critical. Here are some of my hints and pet peeves.

This is a useful https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2022/paper-release-checklist.html[checklist for finalizing and submitting] papers.

## Outlining and Narrative Style
Remember reviewers / me / editors / readers likely spend less than 60 minutes reading the paper. They aren't stupid people, but they can't dedicate time to dissect your arguments. Make it clear. It seems simple to you because you've spent the past six months on the problem. You would be surprised how much knowledge you are assuming. 

https://explorationsofstyle.com/2011/02/09/reverse-outlines/[*Reverse outlining*] is a good way to start. Write a bunch of text. Then number the paragraphs and identify the message/topic of each paragraph. Put those on a whiteboard as stickies. Then order it so that the narrative comes through. Then rewrite the paper accordingly.

Avoid parentheticals and footnotes. Sure, you might think it important in the grand scheme of the work (to capture some minor caveat that is), but for the paper it just confuses readers. But that's ok, because you documented the exceptions in the replication package / notebook. Right? 

A good paper is https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/SE-Intro/fakeit.pdf["A Rational Design Process: How and Why to Fake It"]. Parnas and CLements say "to many observers, the usual process of designing software appears quite irrational."  The paper then motivates why we should pretend to rationality nonetheless.

The same idea applies in writing up results. We aren't trying to recap the process used alongside missteps. We are trying to answer a scientific question. The paper is a abbreviated/abridged summary of how we got there. 

Be short and to the point. Technical writing should not meander [line-through]#around#. You will be amazed at how many words we can cut and still keep the message intact.

## Latex Crap
It is the most useful and most annoying tool we use.

I suggest using the "one line per sentence" approach. This makes merge conflicts simpler in Latex.

It might be useful to have the paper in separate Latex files once it gets large. This reduces merge conflicts. But makes it annoying for some IDE editors to outline.

I have a pro Overleaf account which allows for history and extra collaborators. But if you prefer, using Github is pretty good.

VS Code, BibDesk, and the https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Snippets[Latex Workshop Plugin] are my current preferred tools.

Bibtex! Everything you read you should stick in Bibtex. Checkout doi2bib.org or the VS Code DOI extension. Don't be the student that does not keep track of the research they read.

## Images and tables
- never use lossy formats. I prefer to save everything as vector-style PDF. PNGs look like crap usually.
- Don't be skimpy with captions. The figure or table should stand alone for a reader.
- Always get your outputs to use intermediate data which you save to disk, so we can readily re-generate tables and images. A common scenario is you finish up the research, we submit to a conference, and then when revising I have to figure out how we got a figure to look the way it does. 

## Misc tips
- Write out numbers less than ten. Use digits for bigger numbers like 476. Add a comma to the number if it's more than a thousand.
- Use active voice.
- Academic writing does not use contractions.
- When in doubt write out the abbreviation.
- Et alia -> et al. not et. al or et al 
- Some students of mine have struggled with capitalization (not all languages have the notion of capital letters). In English we capitalize the word starting the sentence and https://www.grammarly.com/blog/proper-nouns/[proper nouns] like GitHub. That's it!
- Be sure to use proper attribution of quotes and other people's work. Plagiarism is a serious academic integrity violation. This includes having GPT4 etc generate ideas and paragraphs for you.
