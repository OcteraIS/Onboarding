This is your jumping off point to get you up and running with your work in collaboration with Dr. Ernst.

I prefer to be called Neil and addressed he/him. 

# Lab Policies
The following policies that guide our lab's conduct and approach.

* Read the [research ethics](ethics.md) guidelines. Chat with Neil if you have any questions about lab norms or would like to add or change anything in the code of conduct. 
* Read my [expectations](expectations.asciidoc).
* Read the [writing tips](writing.asciidoc).

# Chat and Tools
* Join the Teams channel (get a Teams account [at UVic here](https://onlineservices.uvic.ca/).

You should familiarize yourself with university grad student resources, including the department's [Graduate Handbook](https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/computerscience/assets/docs/grad/graduatehandbookcs.pdf) and [international student office](https://www.uvic.ca/international/home/contact/iss/index.php). The latter is very helpful for questions about insurance, health matters, etc.

The [UVic Reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/uvic/) can be useful as well. 

## Cloud Resources
We have an account with Canada's Digital Research alliance / Compute Canada. This is the preferred way of using Cloud resources, but we can organize commercial cloud providers if necessary. See the [compute canada slides](ccdb.pdf) for an intro.
* [Uvic Jupyter server](https://uvic.syzygy.ca)

## Courses and Skillsets
MSc. Students need to take 4 courses and the Research Skills course (595). A few recommendations:

- Data Mining TPCS:SOFTWARE APPLICATION: Data Mining CSC 578D
- CSC 511 Information Visualization
- CSC578B: Topics in Software Applications: "Computer-Supported Collaborative Work"
- CSC581C: Topics in Artificial Intelligence
- My course on Data Science for Software Engineering
- Every semester you should register for CSC 599, the Master's thesis. Do this even if you are "done" with courses.

And others as you (and I) see fit. Check with the graduate handbook.

## Being a good researcher/student

Some ideas of what to [work on from Greg Wilson.](https://third-bit.com/ideas/research/)

I have a few resources here (there are tons). The first is [all the links on Michael Ernst's page](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/). These are all well worth reading. If you are not a strong writer, you should definitely pay attention to the advice on writing. But part of my job is to help you with that (modulo some basic ability). 

The mandatory reading for this onboarding is [Matt Might's](http://matt.might.net/) [Illustrated Guide to a PhD](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/). It's a beautiful description of the frustration and wonder of conducting research.

I have a copy of "Getting What You Came For" in my office.
