This is your jumping off point to get you up and running with your work in collaboration with Dr. Ernst.

# Your first day

* Read the [research ethics](ethics.md) guidelines. Chat with Neil if you have any questions about lab norms or would like to add or change anything in the code of conduct. 
* Join the [slack channel](https://octera.slack.com) by asking [Neil](neil@neilernst.net) to send you an invite.

## Tools
In my work I use the following. I prefer if you do as well. If you want to use Word, for instance, please have a good reason (usually, some funding agency only accepts Word).

* Github
* Git
* Python & Scipy/Pandas & PyStan
* R (less often) 
* Excel! Spreadsheets are great for data exploration.
* Slack

### Latex
* Sharelatex/Authorea - sometimes, more often plain Latex over Git.
* SublimeText for Mac and the Latextools Plugin

## Compute Canada and WestGrid

## Courses and Skillsets
MSc. Students need to take 5 courses and the Research Skills course (595). A few recommendations:
- my Documentation course
- Data Mining
- ML theory
- Info Viz
- CSCW

And others as you (and I) see fit.

## Being a good researcher/student

I have two resources here. The first is [all the links on Michael Ernst's page](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/). These are all well worth reading. If you are not a strong writer, you should definitely pay attention to the advice on writing. But part of my job is to help you with that (modulo some basic ability). 

The other mandatory reading for this onboarding is [Matt Might's](http://matt.might.net/) [Illustrated Guide to a PhD](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/). It's a beautiful description of the frustration and wonder of conducting research.
