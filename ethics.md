Title: Ethical Research 
----

As researchers we seek truth and knowledge through a curiosity-driven approach. Other goals along the way include getting recognition for these pursuits, acquiring funding, getting degrees, learning new skills, and having fun!.

While we do this, we must keep in mind three sets of guidelines to ensure we do this ethically, responsibly, and conduct ourselves appropriately.

# Ethical Research
Ethical research means taking care of the people we do research 'on/with', and working within a moral framework. Many of the studies we conduct involve human beings. As such, they fall under several legal frameworks for protecting research participants. In particular, we *must* comply with the University [research ethics board](https://www.uvic.ca/research/conduct/home/regapproval/humanethics/index.php) and policies [RH8100](https://www.uvic.ca/universitysecretary/assets/docs/policies/RH8100_1200_.pdf) and [RH8105](https://www.uvic.ca/universitysecretary/assets/docs/policies/RH8105_1250_.pdf), and the Tri-Council (NSERC/CIHR/SSHRC) [policy statement](http://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique/initiatives/tcps2-eptc2/Default/). Please read these!

As far as the research we do being within a particular moral code, I tend to address this on a case by case basis, but in all cases, I recommend the [IEEE/ACM code of ethics](https://www.computer.org/web/education/code-of-ethics) as a good starting point. 

# Responsible Research
Here I am referring to our obligation to behave responsibly as researchers. This refers to the following practices. I expect everyone to act responsibly. If you have doubt about whether something you are considering is responsible, please ask! 

1. **Plagiarism**. Our research should be original, but situated within the relevant scholarship. That means we write our own papers, without unattributed copying of other people's work, or even our own work from previous papers. We also follow common citation practices. Again, if you are not familiar with academic practices around citations please ask.
2. **Data malpractice**. This is a bit vague, but I am referring to ensuring our research stands up to detailed scrutiny. This is about avoiding retractions due to erroneous analysis or dishonesty. In most cases, the most detailed scrutiny will be from ourselves (this is the best way to catch mistakes!). This is about not faking data or results, checking and rechecking analysis outcomes, accepting poor results, not p-hacking, and so on (data exploration is expected!). 
3. **Transparency**. Where possible (i.e., not violating a NDA or ethical guidelines), we conduct our science in the open, making our data and analysis accessible to others for replicate. Part of properly following good science practice (2 above) is to carefully write down analysis steps. Jupyter Notebook and R Studio notebooks are great ways to capture this. 

Again, the [university](https://www.uvic.ca/research/conduct/home/policies/index.php) has a policy [governing our conduct as researchers](https://www.uvic.ca/universitysecretary/assets/docs/policies/AC1105_1160_B.pdf), as do venues we submit to, and professional societies like the ACM, have policies in place which govern our actions in a legal sense. Please read these! 

# Code of conduct
Acting badly is not acceptable, and will not be tolerated. The Faculty of Engineering has overarching policies which [govern our behaviour](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/assets/docs/professional-behaviour.pdf), but I don't think it is that hard. Get consent for your actions, treat others professionally, and don't be a dick. Sadly, some people seem to have a hard time doing this. If this happens to you, please let me know. There is no reason to feel like coming to work is unpleasant or dangerous.

# Mental health
You cannot conduct good research if you are not physically and mentally healthy. Working hard does not need to come at the expense of your health. I expect a solid working week of at least 35 hours (work hours, not Facebook or Twitter use). This is surprisingly hard to achieve, but should give plenty of time to both be very successful as a graduate student, as well as having a well-balanced life. You don't get vacation as a grad student (at least I don't think so) but you also don't have regular hours. If you intend to go away for more than a few days, please let me know. 

If you experience health issues, the University has [support in place](https://www.uvic.ca/mentalhealth/graduate/wellness/index.php), including counselling, a health clinic, and thesis completion support.
